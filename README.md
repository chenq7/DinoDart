# Background and Overview:
Minion Wars is a MERN stack project game that is centered around collecting, selling, battling digital tokens called minions. Minions are represented by an image. Each minion has an assigned trait value that is randomized upon creation. Users also have the option of mating their existing minions to create new child minions. The website includes interactions between users. A user has the option of attacking another user's territory, the receiving end will get a notification that another user has attacked them. Attacking users can leave comments to the defending user.
